= Fulcro RAD Demo

This is a demo repository for Fulcro RAD. It includes a shared source directory of files that would be
common to any project, and then separate source directories that have specific files that would be
needed to work with specific back-end technologies (currently SQL and Datomic).

== Building the SPA

You must compile the CLJS source to run the client. If you want to be
able to edit it, just start a shadow-cljs watch:

[source, bash]
-----
$ yarn
$ shadow-cljs watch main
-----

== Running an SQL-based Server

The example code should work with most SQL databases, and the data source
is configured in the `defaults.edn` config file in the sql source
directory. See the HikariCP connection pool documentation.

The SQL example has a custom `development` namespace in the `src/sql` source
folder, along with components needed to run that server.

You can start the server-side version for SQL using the deps aliases that
set up the proper classpath:

[source, bash]
-----
$ clj -A:dev:sql
user=> (require 'development)
user=> (development/go)
-----

== Running a Datomic-based Server

The example code for Datomic components is in the `src/datomic` folder, along with a custom
`development.clj`.

Install Datomic, either Pro or Free. Configure Pro for either a PostgreSQL or MySQL storage engine, then update the config parameters
in `defaults.edn` in the `src/datomic/config` directory to have the correct connection parameters.

For example, something like:
[source, clojure]
-----
 :com.fulcrologic.rad.database-adapters.datomic/databases
    {:main {:datomic/schema           :production
            :datomic/driver           :postgresql ;; OR :mysql :free :mem
            :datomic/database         "example"
            :datomic/prevent-changes? true
            :postgresql/host          "localhost"
            :postgresql/port          5432
            :postgresql/user          "datomic"
            :postgresql/password      "datomic"
            :postgresql/database      "datomic"
            :free/host                "localhost"
            :free/port                4334}}
-----

Then you can run it with the `:datomic` alias and the chosen storage driver alias:

For Postgresql:
[source, bash]
-----
$ clj -A:dev:datomic:postgresql
user=> (require 'development)
user=> (development/go)
-----

Alternatively, for Mysql, Free, or Mem:
[source, bash]
-----
$ clj -A:dev:datomic:mysql
# OR
$ clj -A:dev:datomic:free
# OR
$ clj -A:dev:datomic:mem

-----

== Restarting

The `development/restart` will stop the server, reload source, and start the server.

NOTE: This demo uses CSRF, so you will have to reload the client to get the new CSRF
key on server restarts.

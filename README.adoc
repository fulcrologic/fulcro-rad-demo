= Fulcro RAD Demo 

This is a demo repository for Fulcro RAD. It includes a shared source directory of files that would be
common to any project, and then separate source directories that have specific files that would be
needed to work with specific back-end technologies (currently SQL and Datomic).

IMPORTANT: Login is `tony@example.com` with password `letmein`.

== What is It?

RAD is a set of libraries for Fulcro that have you model your data via _attributes_. An attribute is
a description of a fact in your data model, that itself can have descritive data (ala RDF). Fulcro
components can also be given data attributes. The combination of annotating components and the data
model leads to some great synergies, since Fulcro itself already has the UI components participate 
in your application's global data model. 

The result is a system where a group of attributes can be leveraged to automatically create:

* Database schema
* Networking APIs
* Documentation
* UIs that pull exactly what they need
* Applications that auto-normalize their client-side data
* Form and Report generation
* Federated data modes, where a cluster of attributes can actually 
  live in disparate locations under different control.

and much more.

== Status

RAD includes a number of features that I would recommend in any new production project using Fulcro. 
This demo is a good reference for how to set up such a project; however, RAD is changing rapidly, 
so beware that this demo *may* be somewhat out of date. This is not a template project per-se, but
the RAD approach of designing your data model via attributes that can then be leveraged to generate 
a lot of your boilerplate code is quite useful and powerful in all stages of development.

The demo should be relatively easy for even a beginner to understand and tinker with, and I hope it
serves to inspire you to learn more about Fulcro in general; however, if you
do not understand Fulcro, then you will very quickly run into difficulties.

*Beginners should therefore start with non-RAD projects* using the core library via examples from the
https://book.fulcrologic.com[Developer's Guide] or even the standard https://github.com/fulcrologic/fulcro-template.
RAD does *not* eliminate the need to understand the core library. RAD is simply some macros and patterns
that leverage Fulcro.

The SQL version has some known bugs. If you want to play with RAD, use the Datomic database adapter for now.

== Common FAQ

Does RAD Require a Database (or Server)?:: No the general front-end elements of RAD could be powered by any data source. The main
requirement is that a Fulcro "remote" exist which is able to support an EQL interface. It is trivial
to build a remote that uses anything from an SQL database on a server to Browser LocalStorage.




== Building the SPA

You must compile the CLJS source to run the client. If you want to be
able to edit it, just start a shadow-cljs watch:

[source, bash]
-----
$ yarn
$ shadow-cljs watch main
-----

if you don't have `yarn`, use `npm install` instead.

== Running a Datomic-based Server

The example code for Datomic components is in the `src/datomic` folder, along with a custom
`development.clj`. It defaults to using an in-memory datomic-free database.

You can run it with the `:datomic` deps alias:

[source, bash]
-----
$ clj -A:dev:datomic
user=> (clojure.core/require 'development)
user=> (development/go)
-----

== Using Datomic Cloud

Please see the `datomic-cloud` branch of this repository. An alternate setup is required.

== Running an SQL-based Server (ALPHA quality)

The example code should work with most SQL databases (and defaults to using an in-memory H2 db). The data source
is configured in the `defaults.edn` config file in the sql source
directory. See the HikariCP connection pool documentation.

The SQL example has a custom `development` namespace in the `src/sql` source
folder, along with components needed to run that server.

You can start the server-side version for SQL using the deps aliases that
set up the proper classpath:

[source, bash]
-----
$ clj -A:dev:sql
user=> (clojure.core/require 'development)
user=> (development/go)
-----

== Running an Crux-based Server (ALPHA quality)

The example code for Crux components is in the `src/crux` folder, along with a custom
`development.clj`. Crux nodes are configured by a map under `:roterski.fulcro.rad.database-adapters.crux/databases` key
in `defaults.edn`.

You can run it with the `:crux` deps alias:

[source, bash]
-----
$ clj -A:dev:crux
user=> (clojure.core/require 'development)
user=> (development/go)
-----

== Restarting

The `development/restart` will stop the server, reload source, and start the server.

== Contributing

RAD uses several different libraries at once. It is ideal that you check out the source of all of those and set
up your deps so you can run from the source of them all at once. You may also want to update the `set-refresh-dirs`
in the development namespace to point at those additional source directories in CLJ so you get proper reload there.

=== Running From Source

The *very* active development I'm doing makes changes to 5 projects at once (Fulcro, Fulcro RAD, Fulcro RAD Datomic,
Fulcro RAD SQL, and this demo). I do not guarantee I will keep everything in sync as far as versions in the deps
file go.  I personally set the following in my top-level `~/.clojure/deps.edn`:

[source]
-----
{:aliases {:f3-dev    {:override-deps {com.fulcrologic/fulcro {:local/root "/Users/tonykay/fulcrologic/fulcro"
                                                               :exclusions [com.taoensso/sente]}}}
           :rad-dev   {:override-deps {com.fulcrologic/fulcro-rad                 {:local/root "/Users/username/fulcrologic/fulcro-rad"}
                                       com.fulcrologic/fulcro-rad-sql             {:local/root "/Users/username/fulcrologic/fulcro-rad-sql"}
                                       com.fulcrologic/fulcro-rad-semantic-ui     {:local/root "/Users/username/fulcrologic/fulcro-rad-semantic-ui"}
                                       com.fulcrologic/fulcro-rad-datomic         {:local/root "/Users/username/fulcrologic/fulcro-rad-datomic"
                                                                                   :exclusions [com.datomic/datomic-free]}}}}}
-----

so that in IntelliJ (or at the command line) I can work from local sources for all of them.  I try to remember to push SNAPSHOTS
daily, but if I forget and you see some missing symbol error or things are broken, that is almost certainly why.

Running shadow and clj would look like this from the command line:

[source, bash]
-----
# in one terminal
$ shadow-cljs -A:f3-dev:rad-dev watch main
# in another terminal
$ clj -A:dev:f3-dev:rad-dev:datomic
-----

In IntelliJ, you'd simply make sure to run a CLJ REPL with current classpath, and use the alias checkboxes and `+` button
in the Clojure Deps tab to set it up.
